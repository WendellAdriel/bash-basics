# Bash basics

Beginner in bash/shell-script? 

Below you find some help to commands that you will probaly need.

### PWD
Show where you are in bash. The directory specifically. The command is an abbreviation to ***print working directory***.

```sh
pwd
```

will return a path like this

```sh
/Users/darlanmendonca/projects
```

### CD
Go to a path, relative or absolute. Is an abbreviation to ***change directory***

```sh
# '/'' is a root of HD in unix systems (Linux, MacOS, ...). Similar to 'c:' if yo're in a Windows.
cd /
```

Another example

```sh
# '~'' is an alias to user's directory in unix systems. The complete path is anything like '/Users/darlanmendonca'
cd ~
```

```sh
# path absolute
cd /Users/darlanmendonca
```

```sh
# relative path, I'm in /Users/darlanmendonca, and we want enter in directory projects, inside where we're.
cd projects
```

## Note
with space after command, you can pass multiples arguments to command. In case of ***cd*** command, you only need pass one arguments, but other commands maybe work with multiples. In cases of multiples arguments, just give a space between values.

### MKDIR
Command to ***make a directory***.

```sh
# create a directory called 'nomeDaPasta' in current path
mkdir nomeDaPasta
```

```sh
# create two or more directorys, just give space between arguments.
# in this case, we are create two directory, 'name1' and 'name2', both in the current path.
mkdir name1 name2
```

```sh
# create a directory called 'test' on path '/Users/darlanmendonca/Desktop'
mkdir /Users/darlanmendonca/Desktop/test
```

```sh
# -p is an flag, to create directories (in this case, directory 'parent'), case their not exists
mkdir -p /Users/darlanmendonca/Desktop/test/parent/children
```
